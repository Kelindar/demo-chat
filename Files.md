This page documents the different files in this repository.  It is meant for beginners who do not quite know what is going on.

### .css/styles.css 
This is the css style sheet. 

### .js/app.js 
This is the MQTT client application.  If you do not understand it, there are plenty of good references on the MQTT api on the web. 

### js/app.visitor.js 
Well for chat applications we need to know who everyone is.  And this demo runs with a static web server.  So this part of the software generates a unique id for each user.  If your web server has user ids, then you can safely replace this part of the software.
